Hi {{ $data['first_name'] }},<br /><br />
Rumor has it that you haven’t had an English lesson in the last two weeks, and that you haven’t scheduled a future lesson, either.<br /><br />
Is there a special reason for that?<br /><br />
Keep in mind that having weekly English lessons is your ticket to continuous and CONSISTENT improvement.<br /><br />
Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.<br /><br />
Best,<br />
