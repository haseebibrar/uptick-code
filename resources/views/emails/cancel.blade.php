Hi {{ $data['first_name'] }},<br /><br />
I’m reaching out to you today because I noticed that you’ve made at least two last-minute cancellations recently.<br /><br />
First of all, I completely understand how hard it can be to juggle life circumstances and studies.<br /><br />
Please let me know what's up, if you are still committed to the process, and if there’s anything I can do to help.<br /><br />
Thank you,<br />
